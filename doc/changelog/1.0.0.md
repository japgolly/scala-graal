# 1.0.0

I haven't bothered maintaining release notes for the 0.x.y releases
but I will from here on.

Functionally, nothing much has changed from 0.5.0 as that release was quite
stable and had everything needed. The only change is:

* Language is no longer sealed. Anyone can create their own.


Structurally and nominally however, there have been many changes:

* Instead of a `core` module and `util` module,
  there's now `core` (which has a `.util` package) and a `core-js` module.
  In future, languages other than JS may be directly supported here (not hard)
  in which case `core` will remain stable and now language modules will be added.

* Anything JS-specific has been moved from the `japgolly.scalagraal` package
  to `japgolly.scalagraal.js`

* `Language.Js` is now `LanguageJs` in the `core-js` module
   (not that you ever reference it directly)

* Rename `ContextSync` => `GraalContext`
* Rename `ContextPool` => `GraalContextPool`
* Rename `ContextF` => `AbstractGraalContext`
* Rename `ContextMetrics` => `GraalContextMetrics`

* Many internal classes renamed too

Finally, much more documentation has been added.
